# Objective

The main objective is to understand the entire process of a public procurement procedure, 
complying with the applicable legislation and considering potential political and social events that may directly influence behavioural patterns. 

In addition to these factors, there are errors made by both the contracting authority and the awarded entity.
There are also other factors that may influence these behaviours, provided by the data available on Portal Base, such as:
- the type of procedure (open tendering, restricted tendering, request for proposals, among others);
- the country district and municipality of execution;
- and the CPV, a code that represents the type of service contracted.
